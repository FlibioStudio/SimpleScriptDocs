title: Conditionals
---

Conditionals check something in a script. For example, to check if a player has the permission `test.perm`, type
`player has permission of "test.perm"`. If a conditional is false, any lines of script following the conditional are not ran.
Conditionals are written in the format `<variable> has <property or function> of <expected value>`.
A list of properties and functions can be found on the [variables page](http://flibiostudio.github.io/SimpleScriptDocs/components/variables.html).
